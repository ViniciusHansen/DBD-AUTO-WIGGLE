# What the Macro does?
* This macro saves your keyboard from getting smashed while youÂ´re playing Dead By Daylight.

# Is this Cheating?
* No, this macro only automates the button spam that is required to realize certain actions in game.

# How to use it
* The "Struggle" button must be in the space bar and the movement buttons in the "WASD" (game default)
* Download and run the .exe , when you're done close the icon on the taskbar ![aaaaaa](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/36304846/90157444-1fe83080-dd64-11ea-86be-61eb19e8c91b.png)
